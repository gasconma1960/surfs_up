## Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

1. *Overview of the analysis:* Explain the purpose of this analysis. 
  The idea of running these queries was to help undestand how the weather behave all year-round and seek for answer base on the results whether the Surf and Ice Shop will profitable

2. *Results:* Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
  - The results shows that the average temperature for June are aroung 75 degrees and December Temperature average are 71 degrees. 
  
  - Precipartion are not that bad for June the average is 0.14 inches and 0.22 for the month of December
  
  - Both metrics revise in this project shows a good behave for the purpose of opening the shop all year around
3. *Summary:* Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
  In conclusion I will say that W. Avy should consider that the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
